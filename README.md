# Purpose of this work
- Choose a database and apply the steps of a Machine Learning Project. my problem is for: **Classification**.

- Propose 4 solutions to the problem and at the end inform the most efficient one:
  - a) Choose a Machine Learning model and apply it without use feature selection or dimensionality reduction. Simply apply the model and find the value of R2(for Regression) or 
    Accuracy (for Classification).
  - b) Use the PCA or LDA technique for dimensionality reduction and apply the Same Machine Learning model used in letter a.
  - c) Use a Feature Selection technique and apply the same Machine Learning model used in the letter a.
  - d) Use the Pycaret library to solve the problem.
    
 **OBS**: If you are seeing the code here in GitHub some graphics may not be displayed, because some ones are dynamic. You can open it in the Google Colab.
